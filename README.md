# Pongy
My version of Pong game written fully in C64 assembler :) 
This game (as of v1.22) can be playable with paddles or joysticks...
v1.30 now includes different hit angles and speeds.
This program was developed under C64PRGStudio, however there is also
a Kick Assembler version for the final state.
